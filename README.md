## Little About Me

### Sports
I enjoy physical activities, moving around, and pushing past my limits.
* 🏋️ I aim to go to the gym at least 4 times a week.
* 🎾 Squash is lots of fun and can be quite competitive. Definitely my favourite racket sport.

### Tinkering
* 🤖 Like to get hands on and combine my own software and hardware together. Using microcontrollers such as arduinos is lots of fun.
* 💻 Recently built my first PC. Gained lots of knowledge and experience about computers from making a custom build.
